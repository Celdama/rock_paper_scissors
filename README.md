# Rock Paper Scissor
This is a very basic application of the famous rock paper scissors game made in javascript. <br/>

## Description
The game is initialized to zero and the game starts when the user clicks on one of the three buttons. The result of the round is then calculated, and a point is awarded to the winner of the round. If there is a tie, no points are awarded and the score remains the same. The first to reach 5 points wins the round. The button to replay the round appears and, if the player decides to replay, the score is reset to zero and the game can be resumed. 

For the moment the UI is put aside, I focused only on the JavaScript part. I plan to come back on this application to improve the UI and make it more attractive.
